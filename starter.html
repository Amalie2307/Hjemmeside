	   <img src="exhibition/images/01_rr_music.jpg" alt="Musical Company, Rembrandt van Rijn, 1626, oil on panel, h 63.5cm x w 48cm , the subject of this painting is a mystery: is it an exhortation to praise God through singing and string music, or a scene of seduction with the old woman as a procuress? In any case, in this early work Rembrandt used elements from his own surroundings: his mother modelled for the old woman, and Rembrandt's own features can be recognized in the young man." onclick="myFunction(this);">
    
	   <img src="exhibition/images/02_pc_time.jpg" alt="Time, Pieter Christoffel Wonder, 1810, oil on canvas, h 121.5cm × w 105cm × d 9.5cm, The time. Father Time, naked and with wings on his back, kneeling on his right knee, in profile to the left. He holds up a cloth with his right hand, on the ground lies a golden scale between leaves." onclick="myFunction(this);">

    <img src="exhibition/images/Image3.jpg" alt="View of Houses in Delft, Known as ‘The Little Street’, Johannes Vermeer, c. 1658. This is an unusual painting in Vermeer’s oeuvre, and remarkable for its time as a portrait of ordinary houses. The composition is as exciting as it is balanced. The old walls with their bricks, whitewash, and cracks are almost tangible. The location is Vlamingstraat 40–42 in Delft. Vermeer’s aunt Ariaentgen Claes lived in the house at the right, with her children, from around 1645 until her death in 1670." onclick="myFunction(this);">

  	<img src="exhibition/images/Image4.jpg" alt="The Love Letter, Johannes Vermeer, c. 1669 - c. 1670. Vermeer chose an unusual vantage point for this painting. From a dim space in the foreground, a glimpse is afforded of another room with a domestic scene. An elegantly dressed woman looks up expectantly at a maidservant, who has just handed her a letter. The seascape on the wall behind them may well allude to the epistle’s subject: during the 17th century, the sea was often compared to love, and the lover to a ship."  onclick="myFunction(this);">
